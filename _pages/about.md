About Me
===
I graduated from National Taiwan University (NTU) with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. My research interests lie in **Computer Architecture / VLSI Design**, specifically focusing on machine learning acceleration. Additionally, I am interested in hardware-aware machine learning and agile hardware design.

Under the guidance of Prof. Tsung-Te Liu, I worked on energy-efficient keyword spotting accelerators. With Prof. An-Yeu Wu, I research on energy-aware pruning for non-volatile memory-based computing-in-memory architecture for vision transformers, along with retraining-free constraint-aware token pruning for vision transformers. During an internship at the Industrial Technology Research Institute, I explored event-based spiking neural network processors.

Currently, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. program for the Fall of 2024.
