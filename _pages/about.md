About Me
---
I obtained my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University(NTU). My research interests focus on **Computer Architecture / VLSI design**, especially on machine learning acceleration.

I have the privilege to work with Prof. Tsung-Te Liu on **energy-efficient keword spotting accelerator**, and Prof. An-Yeu Wu on **energy‑aware pruning for NVM‑based computing‑in‑memory
architecture for vision transformer** and **retraining‑free constraint‑aware token pruning for vision transformer**.
